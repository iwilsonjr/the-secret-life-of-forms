                                  <p>There are many things to look out for when choosing a travel insurance provider and although it may appear that some policies are very similar, quality cover is more than just high policy limits. Make sure you compare plans by looking into the sub limits and carefully reading the policy exclusions.</p>

                                    <li>With Cover-More, our policies don&rsquo;t just cover your luggage, they also provide cover for the costs of you having to unexpectedly cancel or amend your trip, accommodation and medical costs should you become ill or get injured, experience a travel delay, have your luggage lost or stolen and much more.</li>

                                    <li>When you compare travel insurance policies ensure you look closely at what cover you&rsquo;ll have for major world disasters. You will soon discover that we cover what many others don't&mdash;including medical costs for injuries resulting from terrorism attacks, civil unrest, strikes, natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, redundancy, working holidays, and unlimited dental.</li>
